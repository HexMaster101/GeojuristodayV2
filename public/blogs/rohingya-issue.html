					INDIA'S APPROACH TO THE ROHINGYA CRISIS: BALANCING NATIONAL SECURITY
					AND HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS.
				</h1>
				<h2 class="blog-head">WHO ARE ROHINGYA?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Rohingya are an ethnic and religious minority group primarily
					composed of Muslims who have traditionally lived in the Rakhine State
					of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). They have their own language and
					distinct culture, but they have faced significant persecution and
					discrimination in Myanmar for many years.<br /><br />
					The Rohingya are ethnically, linguistically, and religiously different
					from Myanmar’s dominant Buddhist community. They speak a dialect of
					Bengali, as opposed to the commonly spoken Burmese language. About 1.1
					million Rohingyas are said to live in Myanmar’s Rakhine region, which
					is Myanmar’s least developed region, with more than 78 per cent of
					households living below the poverty line. Despite living in Myanmar
					for many generations, the Rohingya are not recognized as an official
					ethnic group and have been denied citizenship since 1982, making them
					the world’s largest stateless population. As a stateless population,
					Rohingya families are denied basic rights and protection and are
					extremely vulnerable to exploitation, sexual and gender-based violence
					(SGBV) and abuse. The Myanmar government has often considered them to
					be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite many Rohingya families
					having lived in Myanmar for generations.<br /><br />The plight of the
					Rohingya gained international attention, especially in the last
					decade, due to widespread reports of human rights abuses and violence
					against them. The most significant and deadly episode occurred in 2017
					when a military crackdown in Rakhine State led to a massive exodus of
					Rohingya refugees driving more than 742,000 people to seek refuge in
					neighbouring countries —
					<span>the majority of whom were women and children.</span>
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">HOW DID ROHINGYA REFUGEE CRISIS BEGAN?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					In August 2017, after a massive wave of violence broke out in
					Myanmar’s Rakhine state, this incident was followed by, what has been
					described as ethnic cleansing, or even genocide by the critics. This
					crackdown led to the deaths of at least 10,000 Rohingyas and forced
					more than 742,000 people (according to UN official record) to seek
					refuge in Bangladesh. Entire villages were burned to the ground,
					Thousands of families were killed or separated and massive human right
					violations were reported. The United Nations has described Myanmar’s
					Military offensive that triggered the exodus as a “textbook example of
					ethnic cleansing”. Whereas Bengali Muslims in Bangladesh and India do
					not see the Rohingya as their kin in any respect.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">WHERE ARE THE ROHINGYA SEEKING REFUGE?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					More than 1 million Rohingya refugees have fled violence in Myanmar in
					successive waves of displacement since the 1990s. Now, more than
					960,000 Rohingya refugees are living in Bangladesh with a majority
					settled in and around Kutupalong and Nayapara refugee camps in
					Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar region — some of the largest and most densely
					populated camps in the world. More than half of all Rohingya refugees
					in Bangladesh (52 percent) are children, while 51 percent are
					comprised of women and girls. The current refugee population accounts
					for one-third of the total population in the Cox’s Bazar region,
					making support to host communities essential for peaceful
					coexistence.<br /><br />
					Since 2021, to decongest the 33 camps in Cox’s Bazar, nearly 30,000
					refugees have been relocated to Bhasan Char island by the Government
					of Bangladesh. While protection services and humanitarian assistance
					have been scaled up on the island, significant gaps remain in service
					delivery and the sustainability of critical assistance.<br /><br />
					In addition to Bangladesh, some Rohingya have sought refuge in other
					countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and India.
					However, their situation in these countries varies, with some being
					recognized as refugees and others facing uncertain legal status and
					conditions.<br /><br />
					Armed clashes across Myanmar have continued to trigger displacement,
					bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDP) within
					the country to more than 1.8 million — including 1.5 million of whom
					have been internally displaced since February 2021.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">
					HOW DOES THE MONSOON SEASON IMPACT ROHINGYA REFUGEES IN BANGLADESH?
				</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Monsoon season runs from June to October each year, comes with so
					many challenges for the Rohingya people as it brings with itself heavy
					rainfall and strong winds to Bangladesh, increasing the risk of floods
					and landslides. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have found refuge in
					flimsy shelters made of bamboo and tarp which have been built in areas
					prone to landslides, which may not stand torrential rains and heavy
					winds. Cox's Bazar, while providing temporary refuge for many
					Rohingya, is not a safe place for them to live for several reasons.<br /><br />The
					Cox's Bazar region is prone to natural disasters, including cyclones,
					monsoons, flooding, and landslides. These disasters can lead to loss
					of life, displacement, and destruction of shelters, making it an
					unsafe environment for refugees living in makeshift camps. The refugee
					camps in Cox's Bazar, especially Kutupalong-Balukhali, are severely
					overcrowded. The high population density can lead to unsanitary
					conditions, limited access to basic services, and increased risks of
					disease outbreaks. While humanitarian organizations provide essential
					services to refugees in the camps, the large and growing population of
					refugees can strain the capacity to deliver healthcare, education,
					clean water, and sanitation services. This can result in inadequate
					access to these critical services. There have been reports of security
					concerns within the camps, including incidents of violence and
					criminal activity. These issues can make the living environment less
					safe for Rohingya refugees, particularly women and children. Rohingya
					refugees in Bangladesh often lack formal legal status and citizenship,
					leaving them in a state of vulnerability. They are at risk of
					deportation and may not have access to education, formal employment,
					or the ability to move freely. The harsh conditions and experiences in
					the refugee camps can have severe psychological and emotional impacts
					on the Rohingya, particularly those who have experienced trauma in
					Myanmar. Mental health support is limited, making it difficult for
					refugees to cope with their circumstances. The camps in Cox's Bazar
					were initially set up as a temporary solution, but the protracted
					nature of the Rohingya crisis has meant that many refugees have been
					living there for years without clear prospects for a better future.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">HOW IS ROHINGYA CRISIS AFFECTING CHILDREN?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					While basic services have been provided, children still face disease
					outbreaks, malnutrition, inadequate educational opportunities and the
					risks related to neglect, exploitation and violence including
					gender-based violence risks, child marriage and child labour.
					Meanwhile, annual cycles of heavy monsoon and cyclones pose
					substantial risks to both Rohingya refugees and host communities.
					Rohingya children in Rakhine State, have been hemmed in by violence,
					forced displacement and restrictions on freedom of movement.
					<br /><br />Older children and adolescents who are deprived of
					opportunities to learn or make a living are at real risk of becoming a
					“lost generation,” ready prey to traffickers and those who would
					exploit them for political or other ends. Girls and women are at
					particular risk of sexual and other gender-based violence in this
					situation, including being forced into early marriage and being left
					out of school as parents keep them at home.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">HOW IS INDIA HANDLING THE ISSUE?</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					India's stance on the Rohingya issue reflects a complex balancing act
					between its national security concerns, geopolitical interests,
					domestic considerations, and its humanitarian responsibilities. The
					issue highlights the challenges that countries face when dealing with
					refugee crises and the need for a nuanced and comprehensive approach
					that considers both security and humanitarian aspects.<br /><br />India
					have been recieving Rohingya refugees and allowing them to settle in
					the different parts of the country over the years, especially after
					the communal voilence in the state of Rakhine. However, India
					considers the refugee crisis as an internal affair of Myanmar. India
					also believes that ASEAN has an undeniable responsibility to resolve
					this crisis. Since India is not a signatory to the United Nations
					Convention on Refugees, refugee status granted by the United Nations
					High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Rohingya was irrelevant
					to their deportation.<br /><br />India is home to about 40,000
					Rohingya refugees. Of these approximately 16,000 are registered with
					the UN Refugee Agency. While the United Nations has called upon the
					Indian government to provide Rohingya with the necessary protection,
					India maintains that they are a threat to its national security and
					have links with international terror groups. In India, the term
					‘Rohingya’ is not used in public statements or documents. Citizenship
					(Amendment) Bill, 2016 further cleared the government’s stand, it
					provided that : <br /><br /><br />The Bill aims to amend the 1955
					Citizenship Act, to provide citizenship to illegal migrants from
					<span>Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan</span>, who are of
					Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi or Christian.<br /><br />India
					deported a few Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar in October 2018 by
					handing over them to Myanmar authorities. India has abstained from
					voting on a resolution backed by Bangladesh in United Nations Human
					Right Council (UNHRC), criticizing the Myanmar government over its
					dealing with Rohingya crisis. It has displeased the Bangladeshi
					government. The Supreme Court of India has asked Union Government to
					strike a balance between humanitarian concern for Rohingya community
					staying in India and country’s economic and national security
					interests. SC has refused to release 300 Rohingyas from detention
					camps in Jammu and Delhi. The court called for their
					<span>deportation under the Foreigners Act, 1946.</span>
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">PROVISION PROTECTING REFUGEES IN INDIA.</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					The Supreme Court of India held that Refugees cannot invoke Article 32
					of Indian Constitution. However, the Constitutional safegaurd of
					Article 14 and 21 are equally available to every person including
					refugees. While, other fundamental rights are only available to the
					citizens of India. Whereas, Article 51 of the constitution mandates
					the state to promote international peace and security. The Supreme
					Court of India did not comment on the genocide that is happening in
					Myanmar. Though India is non-signatory to the refugee convention 1951
					or its 1967 protocol, India is bound by the principle of
					Non-Refoulement. Principle of Non-Refoulement is binding on all UN
					member states that does not allow any country to return people who
					have sought refuge within their borders, to a country in which there
					is high likelihood that they would face persecution based on race,
					religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or
					political opinion. Under Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of
					Human Rights, anyone can seek asylum in another country from
					persecution.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">ISSUES AND CONCERNS TO INDIA'S SECURITY.</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					Though India has been receiving Rohingya refugees and allowing them to
					settle in the different parts of the country over the years but India
					expressed concerns that some Rohingya refugees might pose security
					risks, as they could potentially be vulnerable to radicalization by
					extremist groups. The Indian government believed that they could be
					used by militant organizations to further their agendas. As a result,
					India viewed the presence of Rohingya refugees as a potential national
					security threat. India shares a border with Myanmar and has been keen
					on maintaining good relations with the Myanmar government. Myanmar is
					seen as a strategic partner in India's "Act East" policy and in
					countering Chinese influence in the region. India has sought to
					maintain friendly ties with Myanmar's military, which has been
					criticized for its treatment of the Rohingya population. India's
					foreign policy decisions are often influenced by these geopolitical
					considerations. While India has expressed concern about the situation
					of the Rohingya, its response has been more focused on providing
					humanitarian assistance to the community, rather than offering asylum.
					India has contributed aid to support Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh
					and provided assistance to internally displaced Rohingya in Myanmar's
					Rakhine State. India has contended that the Rohingya refugees do not
					have legal status in the country, and it has sought to deport those
					living in India back to Myanmar. This approach has faced legal
					challenges, with human rights groups and activists arguing that
					deporting Rohingya refugees to Myanmar would expose them to the risk
					of persecution.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">
					CURRENT LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK IN INDIA TO HANDEL REFUGEES.
				</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					<span>Foreigners Act of 1946: </span>Under Section 3 of this act the
					central government is empowered
					<span>to detect, detain and deport illegal foreign nationals.</span
					><br /><br />
					<span>Registration of Foreigners Act of 1939: </span>
					Under this, there is a mandatory requirement under which all foreign
					nationals (excluding overseas citizens of India) visiting India on a
					long-term visa (more than 180 days) are
					<span
						>required to register themselves with a Registration Officer within
						14 days of arriving in India. </span
					><br /><br />
					<span>Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920: </span>Under Section 5,
					authorities can remove an illegal foreigner by force under
					<span>Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India. </span><br /><br />
					<span>Citizenship Act, 1955: </span>It provided provisions for
					renunciation, termination, and deprivation of citizenship.<br /><br />Further,
					Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) seeks to provide citizenship to
					Hindu, Christian, Jain, Parsi, Sikh, and Buddhist immigrants
					persecuted in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
				</p>
				<h2 class="blog-head">STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE.</h2>
				<p class="blog-para">
					Although positive steps have been taken by India, it's notable that
					all these developments began soon after China stepped in with its
					“three-step solution” to the Rohingya crisis and did not compel anyhow
					to Myanmar to take any reformative steps towards the rehabilitation of
					Rohingya. India is concerned that raising the issue publicly might
					push Myanmar towards China. China has entered in almost all
					neighbouring countries of India. India also has a connectivity
					interest to link its landlocked northeastern region with the Bay of
					Bengal through Rakhine State under a joint project with Myanmar that
					includes port at Sittwe, Kaladan River and road construction in
					North-East. India is suffering from cross-border ethnic insurgency
					from Myanmar based militants, thus it requires the support of the
					Myanmar military to deal with them. India needs to ensure that no
					Rohingya refugee in India is deported back to Myanmar until it is safe
					to do so. Like any nation, India has the right to prioritise its
					national security. However, security concerns need to take into
					account the comprehensive long-term consequences. Moreover, given its
					historical bent towards protecting refugees, India must rise to the
					occasion and demonstrate that it is not driven solely by narrow
					domestic political interests. In spite of not being a party to the
					1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, India has been one of
					the largest recipients of refugees in the world. Therefore, if India
					had Domestic legislation regarding refugees, it could have deterred
					any oppressive government in the neighbourhood from persecuting their
					population and making them flee to India.
